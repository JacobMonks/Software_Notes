JAVA INTRO:

Java is a general-purpose, high-level programming language.
It was created with the basic idea: "Write once, run anywhere."

Indeed, Java is an incredibly versatile programming language that can run virtually anywhere.
The only thing a system needs to run Java programs is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- The JVM translates and compiles Java code into Bytecode. This allows a computer to read it.

Before creating programs with Java, you will need to download a Java Development Kit (JDK).

The JDK contains the following:
1. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
2. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
3. Standard Java libraries.

FIRST JAVA PROGRAM:

All Java programs must have a file called "Main.java"
- A Java file is known as a "class."
- This will be the file that gets executed when you run a program.
- The skeleton of the "Main.java" file consists of the following code:

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

	}

}

Inside the public static void brackets, you can put any executable code and click "run" to execute it.

JAVA DATATYPES:

There are 8 primitive datatypes in Java:

type:		size:		primitive/reference:	value:
boolean		1 bit		primitive		true or false
byte		1 byte		primitive		-128 to 127
short		2 bytes		primitive		-32768 to 32767
int		4 bytes		primitive		-2 billion to 2 billion
long		8 bytes		primitive		-9 quintillion to 9 quintillion
float		4 bytes		primitive		fractional number up to 6-7 digits
double		8 bytes		primitive		fractional number up to 15 digits
char		2 bytes		primitive		single character
string		varies		reference		a sequence of cahracters

Data types are either Primitive or Reference.
- Primitive datatypes store a value, reference datatypes store a memory address.
- Primitive datatypes can only hold 1 value, reference datatypes can hold many.
- Primitive datatypes take up far less memory than reference datatypes.
- Primitive datatypes are faster to create, modify, and delete than reference datatypes.
