This section contains the other fundamentals that don't fit neatly in any category.
- Comments
- HTML version differences
- global attributes like "class" and "id"
- embedding pages
- Adding special characters

HTML4:
- HTML4 released in 1997.
- HTML4 had some presentational elements that are not recemmended to use anymore.
    - This should all be relegated to CSS.

XHTML1:
- Released in 2000.
- A way to incorporate the functions of XML into HTML
- Has some extra rules:
    - Every element needs a closing tag, there are no empty elements.
    - Attribute names must be in lowercase.
    - All attributes require a value.
    - Every element that was opened inside another element should be closed inside that same element.
- The advantage here is that XHTML works seamlessly with other programs that are written to create and process XML documents.

HTML5:
- Web page authors do not need to close all tags.
- New elements and attributes introduced.

DOCTYPE:
It is good practice for each webpage you create to begin with a DOCTYPE declaration, specifying the HTML version.
This can help the browser render the page properly.
E.g.

<!DOCTYPE html>		-- This is for HTML5

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC	-- This is for HTML 4
  "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC	-- This is for Transitional XHTML 1.0
  "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/
   xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC	-- This is for Strict XHTML 1.0
  "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/
   xhtml1-strict.dtd">

<?xml version="1.0" ?> 	-- This is for XML

COMMENTS:
- These will not be visible in the browser.
	<!-- comment goes here -->
- Comments are essential for enterprise websites because, no matter how familiar you are with the page when you write it,
  comments make it easier to understand it when going back to it, or when the code is observed by someone else.

ID ATTRIBUTE:
- Every HTML element can carry the "id" attribute. The value should start with a letter or underscore and be unique for each element.
- This is useful when using CSS to refer to specific elements.
- For example, you may want to style one paragraph on a page differently from the rest.
- It is also useful for allowing specific interactivity with JavaScript.

CLASS ATTRIBUTE:
- Every HTML element can carry the "class" attribute.
- Rather than uniquely identifying individual elements, this allows you to identify several elements as if they were a group.
- For example, you want certain bits of text to be colored differently to emphasize their importance.
- You can also have an element belong to multiple classes by separating each value with a space.
E.g.

<p class="important">This is part of the "important" class, so maybe
	it will be all capitalized.</p>
<p class="important admittance">This is part of the "important" class and the "admittance" class.
	It might be capitalized and highlighted or colored differently.</p>

BLOCK ELEMENTS:
- Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window.
- These include <p>, <h1>, <ul>, and <li>

INLINE ELEMENTS:
- Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as neighboring elements.
- These include <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.

GROUPING TEXT AND ELEMENTS IN A BLOCK:
- <div>
- This element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
- For example, one block might contain all the elements for the header of the site (logo, navigation, etc.)
- In a browser, the contents of the <div> element will start on a new line.
- You can also use "id" and "class" attributes on a <div> element to create
  CSS style rules to change its appearance or state how much space it takes up on the screen.
- It is a good idea to add comments to a closing </div> tag to clarify what opening tag it corresopnds to.

- <span>
- This is basically an inline equivalent to <div>.
- This is useful if you want to have certain words in a paragraph appear differently.

IFRAMES:
- <iframe>
- This is a small window inside of your page thaat can contain another page.
- Think of when pages have Google Maps in the middle of the page.
- Some important attributes:
	"src" - specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame.
	"height"/"width" - specifies the dimensions of the iframe in pixels.
	"scrolling" - not supported by HTML5, but gives the iframe a scrollbar.
	"frameborder" - not supported by HTML5, indicates that the iframe has a border.
	"seamless" - new attribute for HTML5, apply to an iframe if a scrollbar is not required.
E.g.

<iframe
  width="450"
  height="350"
  src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york&amp;output=embed">
</iframe>

OTHER INFORMATION:

<meta>
- This element lives inside the <head> and contains information about the page.
- It is not visible on the browser.
- Tells search engines key information about the page:
  - Who wrote it?
  - Time sensitive?
- Some important attributes:
	"name" - indicates the property you are setting.
	"content" - value that the property will have.
	"http-equiv" - a way to set rules for the page.
- "name" has some defined values but can be anything you want.
	"description" - maximum of 155 characters, tells a search engine what the page is about.
	"keywords" - comma-separated words that a user might search for to find the page.
	"robots" - indicates if a search engine should add this page to search results.
- "http-equiv" also has some important values:
	"author" - defines the webpage's author.
	"pragma" - prevents the browser from caching the page.
	"expires" - indicates when the page should expire and can no longer be cached.
		  - Requires a specific format: Day, ## Mon YEAR HH:MM:SS ZON
E.g.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Information About Your Pages</title>
    <meta name="description"
	content="An Essay on Installation Art" />
    <meta name="keywords"
	content="installation, art, opinion" />
    <meta name="robots"
	content="nofollow" />
    <meta http-equiv="author"
	content="Jon Duckett" />
    <meta http-equiv="pragma"
	content="no-cache" />
    <meta http-equiv="expires"
	content="Fri, 29 Sep 2023 23:59:59 GMT" />
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

Escape Characters:
- Some characters like <, >, &, and " are reserved by HTML code, so you need to use "escape characters" to write them in text.
- Be sure to check your webpage to ensure these characters actually show up, because not all fonts support them.
- These also allow for some special characters like the Copyright symbol, Greek/Latin letters, and math symbols.
