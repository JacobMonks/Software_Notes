HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "HyperText" means that you can
create links that allow users to move from one page to another.

Here's an example of very basic html structure:

<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is the title of the page.</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The "h1" denotes the Main heading.</h1>
    <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. It might
       go onto multiple lines as you see here.</p>
    <h2>The "h2 denotes a sub-heading. You can have multiple sub-headings under a Main heading.</h2>
    <p>Many pages and articles use sub-headers to structure and organize
       what is being written. This helps readers follow the ideas more cleanly.</p>
    <h2>This is another sub-heading.</h2>
    <p>Here you can read under a second sub-heading.</p>
  </body>
</html>

Everything written in <> is html code, specifically these are called ELEMENTS.
Elements are made up of two TAGS, an opening and a closing tag. Tags act as a sort of container for information.
Breaking down each tag:

<html> - Denotes that everything between this and </html> is html code.
<head> - Contains information about the page. This normally contains a title which is what you see on the tab.
<body> - Everything between this and </body> should be shown inside the main browser window.
<h1> - This is a Main Heading.
<h2> - This is a Sub Heading.
<p> - This is a paragraph.

ATTRIBUTES can be written inside of the tags to provide additional information.
For example:

<p lang="en-us">This is a paragraph written in English.</p>

Attribute NAMES (lang) should be written in lowercase.
Attribute VALUES ("en-us") should be written in double quotes.
Attributes are pre-defined and associated with specific tags, but some like "lang" can be used on any tag.
