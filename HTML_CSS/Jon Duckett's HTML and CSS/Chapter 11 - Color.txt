Color adds life to a webpage.

You can specify color in three different ways:

1. RGB VALUES:
- specify how much Red, Green, and Blue are used to make the color.
- E.g. 
	color: rgb(100,100,90);

2. HEX CODES:
- basically the same as RGB just written in hexadecimal.
- E.g. 
	color: #ee3e80;

3. COLOR NAMES:
- there are 147 pre-defined color names
- E.g.
	color: DarkCyan;

BACKGROUND-COLOR sets the color of the background for an element.
By default, the color is transparent. This usually appears White, but users can set their own default colors,
so to be sure it is the color you want, specify the color in the <body> element.

CSS3 introduces the "opacity" property, a value from 0.0 to 1.0.
You can also affect opacoty by using the "rgba" property and setting a 4th value.
E.g.
p.one {
  background-color: rgb(0,0,0);
  opacity: 0.5;}
p.two {
  background-color: rgb(0,0,0);
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);}

CSS3 also gives a new way to specify colors, HSL (hue-saturation-lightness)
Hue - a way to identify colors as represented by a circle, expressed as an angle between 0 and 360.
Saturation - the amount of gray in the color, expressed as a percent.
Lightness - the amount of white/black in a color, expressed as a percent. 0% is black, 100% is white, 50% is normal.

There is also a 4th property called "alpha" which represents transparency, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
E.g.
body {
  background-color: hsl(0,0%,78%);}
p {
  background-color: hsla(0,100%,100%,0,5);}
