Images help make your website's presentation more appealing and interesting.
Images should:
- Be relevant
- Convey information
- Convey the right mood
- Be instantly recognisable
- Fit the color palette

You can get stock images from the following sites:
www.istockphoto.com
www.gettyimages.com
www.veer.com
www.sxc.hu
www.fotolia.com

Remember that all images are subject to copyright.
You must pay a subscription fee to gain access to and free use of these images.

It is good practice to keep all images in a separate directory, potentially with multiple subdirectories.

Use the <img> tag to add a new image into your webpage.
The <img> empty element has several key attributes:
1. src - tells the browser where the image can be found. This is usually a relative URL to the image in your folders.
2. alt - provides a text description of the image if you cannot see it, important for visually impaired users and search engines.
3. (optional) title - contains any additional information about the image.
4. (optional) height and width - specify the pixel dimensions of the image, this makes the page allocate
                                 space for an image to appear if it takes a while to load.

In the case where the image is not meant to be descriptive and is just for visual flair, the "alt" attribute should be empty quotes.
E.g.

<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" title="The quokka is an
 Australian marsupial that is similar in size to the domestic cat." 
 width="600" height="450" />

Image placement is important. In HTML4 and earlier, the "align" element was
used to place the image in specific spots relative to the text on the page.
Nowadays, this is done mostly with CSS.

The "align" element can take several different values:
- left
- right
- top
- middle
- bottom

To make the text wrap around the image, you will need to use CSS.

When creating images, there are 3 basic rules:
1. Save images in the right format (jpeg, png, gif).
2. Save images with the right dimensions.
3. Measure images in pixels.

Image formats:
JPEG - preferred when an image has many different colors and shades.
GIF - preferred when there is little color variety or images have large areas of single colors, popular for logos and diagrams.
PNG - preferred for graphic design, allows transparent backgrounds or gradient filters, but has more data.

Image Dimensions should be how many pixels you want them to appear on the page. This might require using image editing tools.
Downsizing a large image is more effective than blowing up a small image because image quality usually isn't increased to accomodate.
When creating images for print, it is best to have at least 300 pixels per inch.

When an image is a line drawing, designers will often create it in vector format. This is done by
drawing lines on a grid and filling in the space between them. This method allows images to
be increased or decreased without any loss of quality.

<figure> and <figcaption> is a tag that can be used when you want an image to have a caption.
E.g.

<figure>
  <img src="images/otters.jpg" alt="Photograph of two sea otters floating in water" />
  <br />
  <figcaption>Sea otters hold hands when they sleep so they don't drift away from each other.</figcaption>
</figure>
