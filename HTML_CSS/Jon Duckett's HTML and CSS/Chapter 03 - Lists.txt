HTML offers three different types of LISTS:
- ORDERED LISTS
	Each item is numbered.
	Useful for a set of steps in a process or numbered sections in legal documentation.

	Ordered lists are created with the <ol> tag.
	Each item in the list is marked with <li>
	E.g.
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
	  <li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20 minutes</li>
	  <li>heat milk, butter, and nutmeg</li>
	  <li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
	  <li>Mix in milk mixture</li>
	</ol>

- UNORDERED LISTS
	Begin with bullet points instead of numbers.
	This is useful when there is no particular order.

	Created with the <ul> tag.

- DEFINITION LISTS
	Made up of terms with definitions.

	Created with <dl> tags, with <dt> and <dd> elements inside of them.
	E.g.

	<dl>
	  <dt>Atom</dt>
	  <dd>A fundamental unit of matter belonging to a specific element.</dd>
	  <dt>Molecule</dt>
	  <dd>A combination of multple atoms bonded together that has its own set of properties.</dd>
	</dl>

- These can be used to create NESTED LISTS
	E.g.

	<ul>
	  <li>Mousses</li>
	  <li>Pastries
	    <ul>
	      <li>Corissant</li>
	      <li>Mille-feuille</li>
	      <li>Palmier</li>
	      <li>Profiterole</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Tarts</li>
	</ul>
