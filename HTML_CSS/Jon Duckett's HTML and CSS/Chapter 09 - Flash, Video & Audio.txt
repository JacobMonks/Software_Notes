Flash is used to add video, audio, and animations to websites.

What is Flash?
- An animation tool that was released in the late 90s by Adobe.
- To view Flash, browsers require a plugin called the Flash Player.
- Flash Player stopped being supported in December 2020, and Adobe blocked Flash content from running on Flash Players in 2021.
- Adobe suggests that all users uninstall Flash Player for security reasons.

In HTML5, you can embed video and audio with their own elements:
<video>
<audio>
