Links allow for the swift and easy transitions from one webpage to another.
Links can be divided into a few types:
	1. Links from one website to another.
	2. Links from one page to another on the same website.
	3. Links from one part of a webpage to another part of the same page.
	4. Links that open in a new browser window.
	5. Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone.

Links are created using the <a> element. Use the href Attribute to specify the page to link to.
E.g.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>

- Links to other websites:
	E.g.

	<p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://www.empireonline.com">Empire</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.metacritic.com">Metacritic</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com>Rotten Tomatoes</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.variety.com>Variety</a></li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

- Links to other pages on the same site:
	This is done the same way, but rather than type the full absolute URL, you can just type the relative URL, also called simply the path.
	E.g.

	<p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
	    <li><a href="about-us.html">About</a></li>
	    <li><a href="movies.html">Movies</a></li>
	    <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	It's a good idea to organize your code by palcing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder (also called directory).
	The main homepage of any website is typically called "index.html".
	Web servers are usually set up to return the "index.html" file if no other file is specified by the URL.

- Email links:
	You can create links that start up the user's email and addresses an email to a specific email address.
	This is done by starting the "href" attribute with "mailto:" and give the email address.
	E.g.
	
	<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>

- Links in a new window:
	You might want a link to open a new window.
	For example, this is useful if there is volatile user-inserted information on the current page.
	This is often done when it links to another website.
	It is generally good practice to inform users when the link opens in a new window.

	This is performed by setting the "target" attribute in the <a> tag and setting it to "_blank".
	E.g.

	<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">Internet Movie Database</a> (Opens in new window)</p>

- Link to a specific part of the same page:
	At the top of a very long page, you might want to add a list of contents that links to the corresponding sections down below.
	You might also want to add a link on the bottom that brings you back to the top of the page.

	The first step is identifying which parts of the page that the links can go to.
	This is done using the "id" attribute. The value should start with a letter or an underscore, no number or special character.
	Creating the links is done the same way with the "href" attribute, and the value is the # followed by the id values of those sections.
	E.g.

	<h1 id="Top">Film-Making Terms</h1>
	  <a href="#arc-shot">Arc Shot</a><br />
	  <a href="#interlude">Interlude</a><br />
	  <a href="#prologue">Prologue</a><br /><br />
	<h2 id="arc-shot"></h2>
	  <p>A shot in which the subject is photographed by an encircling or moving camera</p>
	<h2 id="interlude">Interlude</h2>
	  <p>A brief, intervening film scene or sequence, not specifically tied to the plot, thatappears within a film</p>
	<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
	  <p>A speech, preface, inrtoduction, or brief scene preceeding the main action or plot of a film; contrast to epilogue</p>
	  <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
