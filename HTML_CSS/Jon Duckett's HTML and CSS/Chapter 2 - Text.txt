HTML allows up to 6 levels of headings. (h1,h2,...,h6)
Each level is a smaller font size than the last.

You can use some tags to adjust how the text appears in a paragraph:

bold <b> - <p>This paragraph contains a letter that is <b>bolded.</b></p>
italicize <i> - <p>Here's an example of using the <p>italicize</i> tag.</p>
superscript <sup> - <p>Today is September 13<sup>th</sup> 20023.</p>
subscript <sub> - <p>The atmosphere consists partly of O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

A handy thing to know: extra whitespace and line breaks in the middle of paragraphs will appear on the browser as single spaces.
This is useful for when the webpage author needs to break up the text to make it more readable.

If you want to add a line break manually in the middle of a paragraph, you can just type <br />
If you want to note a transition of topic/scene/etc. between two paragraphs, you can type <hr /> between them.

These are called EMPTY ELEMENTS because they do not contain an opening/closing tag, just a single tag without any words.

There are some other markup options that do not alter the structure of the webpage but do have specific use cases:
<em> - adds emphasis to a word or phrase, this is useful for text-to-speech screen readers.
<blockquote> - indicates a block of text is a quotation, useful for getting picked up bby search engines.

<em> and <strong> have a similar purpose, but <em> diplays text in italics while <strong> displays it in bold.
<blockquote> is usually used for quotes that take up entire paragraphs, while <q> is used for shorterquotes that sit within a paragrph.
When using <blockquote>, make sure to have it encompass a pair of <p> tags.
E.g.

<blockquote cite="https://hosting-site.com">This is a quote from the mentioned citation.<blockquote>

<abbr> denotes abbreviations and acronyms. HTML4 used a separate tag for acronyms <acronym> byt HTML5 combined them.
E.g.

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking was a theoretical physicist and cosmologist.</p>
<p><abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> was inspired by his findings and theories.</p>

<cite> is used when citing a specific work such as a book, film, or research paper. This will render any cited text in italics.

<dfn> is used to specify the first time a piece of terminology has been defined in the text.

<address> denotes the contact information for the webpage author. It can be an email, phone number, or physical location.
E.g.

<address>
  <p>(123) 456-7890</p>
  <p><a href="mailto:homer@sample.org">homer@sample.org</a></p>
  <p>123 Sample Street, Example City.</p>
</address>

<ins> and <del> are used to show information that has been inserted or deleted from a document.
E.g.

<p>This is an example of using the <del>delete</del> <ins>insert</ins> tag.</p>

<s> indicates information that is no longer true but should not be removed.
E.g.

<p>Laptop:</p>
<p><s>Was $499.99</s></p>
<p>Now only $349.99</p>
