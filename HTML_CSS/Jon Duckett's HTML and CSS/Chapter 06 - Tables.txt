Tables are useful for containing records such as stock reports, timetables, and sports player statistics.
The data is represented in a grid format with rows and columns.

Create a table using <table> element, then you can use these tags inside of it:
<tr> - table row, indicates the start of a new row.
<td> - table data, denotes a single cell of the table, goes inside of <tr>.
<th> - table heading, defines the header for a column or a row.

When using <th>, you can use the "scope" attribute to indicate whether the heading is for a "row" or "col".
E.g.

<table>
  <tr>
    <-- Create an extra header for the whitespace in the top left corner -->
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Tickets Sold:</th>
    <td>120</td>
    <td>135</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Total Sales:</th>
    <td>$600</td>
    <td>$675</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Even if you have no data for a specific cell, you should still use <td> or <th> so the table can render correctly.

You might have to insert data that stretches across multiple columns, such as keeping an hourly schedule.
In those instances, you can use the "colspan" and "rowspan" attributes to have the data look cleaner and less redundant in the grid.
E.g.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">9am</th>
    <th scope="col">10am</th>
    <th scope="col">11am</th>
    <th scope="col">12pm</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Monday</th>
    <td colspan="2">Geography</td>
    <td>Art</td>
    <td rowspan="2">Math</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Tuesday</th>
    <td colspan="3">Gym</td>
  </tr>
</table>

There are three more table elements you can use to distinguish between the top, middle, and bottom rows of the table:
- <thead>
- <tbody>
- <tfoot>

These help people with screen readers and make the data more visually discernible, especially when incorporating CSS.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Date</th>
      <th scope="col">Income</th>
      <th scope="col">Expenditure</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>1st January</th>
      <td>250</td>
      <td>36</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2nd January</th>
      <td>285</td>
      <td>48</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <td></td>
    <td>535</td>
    <td>84</td>
  </tfoot>
</table>

In certain CMS (content management systems), they may provide a <thead> element for you to put column headers.
This could be useful if the table is bigger than the screen, and you want the table headers to follow the user down the page.

In older HTML code, you might also come across some other attributes:
"width" - indicates the pixel width of the table or the cell.
"cellpadding" - adds extra space in each cell.
"cellspacing" - adds extra space between each cell.
"border" - indicates the thickness of the borders.
"bgcolor" - indicates the background color of the table or of individual cells.
